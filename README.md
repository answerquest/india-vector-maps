# india-vector-maps

An open source project to pump out maps (web pages) with made-for-India vector styles, thematic maps, multilingual, whatnot.


The contents of folders versatiles-sprites/ and versatiles-styles/
are from the repo: https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-style/releases/tag/v4.4.1

Starting web page: map1.html

It's a very basic, no-frills map using the Maplibre JS library.
